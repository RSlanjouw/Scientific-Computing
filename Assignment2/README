## Assignment 1
In this repo the files are found for the first Assingment for Scientific Computing. Running the files can just be done as normal. 

The answers of the questions can be found in:
A - Folder 21 where 21.ipynb presents the code needed to answer question A. The bonus improvement is shown and explained in the 21BONUS.ipynb file.
B - Folder 22 where 22.ipynb presents the code needed to answer question B. 
C - Folder 23 where 23.ipynb presents the code needed to answer question C. Also the pictures are saved in the folder. 

### Folder and file structure
The files are seprated in 3 folders. Each folder contains the ipynb to answer the questions. 


### Comments
Because the files are seperated there are not a lot of comments about specific things because it should be easy readable already. To much comments are also a bad pratice. Note that most of the functions are written in the ipynb but for 21 the funcitons are in the modules folder.
