## Assingment 1
In this repo the files are found for the first Assingment for Scientific Computing. Running the files can just be done as normal. 

The answers of the questions can be found in:
A - See Report
B - ./1.1/start.py and ./1.1/Assignment_1_1_Balthazar.ipynb
C - ./1.1/Assignment_1_1_Balthazar.ipynb
D - ./1.2-1.6/visualize_diffusion.py
E - ./1.2-1.6/compare_analytical_TDE.py
F - ./1.2-1.6/plot_y_x_time.py
G - ./1.2/Assignment_1_2_Balthazar.ipynb, visualize_diffusion.py
H - ./1.2-1.6/plot_optimal_sor.py
I - ./1.2-1.6/plot_iterations_tol.py
J - ./1.2-1.6/sor_omega.ipynb
K - ./1.2-1.6/sink_calculate.py - ./1.2-1.6/sink_visualize.py 
Bonus - SEE K

### Folder and file structure
The files are seprated in three folders whereby the 1.1 and 1.2-1.6 contain the seprate python files and the other folders notebooks for mostly experimentating and some results. Each plot file first does a test or the data is saved in the ./data folder and if not runs the code to generate the data.
